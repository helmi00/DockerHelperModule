# Fibonacci Docker Application

This project is a Docker-based application that generates Fibonacci numbers. It consists of a Docker container running a Node.js application written in TypeScript. The application outputs Fibonacci numbers either indefinitely (one number every 0.5 seconds) or a specific Fibonacci number based on the input provided.

The project also includes a PowerShell module named 'DockerHelper' with cmdlets for building Docker images, copying prerequisites to a remote host, and running Docker containers.

## How to Run the Fibonacci Container

1. First, ensure that Docker is installed on your machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Build and run the Docker image by running the following command:

```bash
.\RunFibonacciContainer.ps1
```
